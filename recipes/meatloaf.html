        <p>This best ever meatloaf recipe lives up to its name and is my favorite I have found. Try it and you will see.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 slices bread, crumbled</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and ground black pepper in a large bowl. Add crumbled bread and stir until dissolved. Mix ground beef, onion, Cheddar cheese, and carrot into bread mixture; transfer mixture to a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Combine brown sugar, ketchup, and mustard in a small bowl; spread over the meat mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 60 to 75 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
